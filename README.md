## Running Locally

Before creating a PR, make sure to run your code on a test bot to make sure there's no issues first.

After cloning the repository, create a `config.json` file.

```json
{
    "token": "<token>",
    "clientID": "<client id>",
    "developers": ["<your user id>"],
    "moderators": ["<your user id>"],
    "topggToken": "TEST",
    "webhookAuth": "TEST"
}
```

Also create a `database.sqlite` file to store city data.

Run the bot with `npm start` and you should see a message like this:

```
Database synced.
Refreshing X commands.
Successfully reloaded X commands.
Logged in as X!
```
